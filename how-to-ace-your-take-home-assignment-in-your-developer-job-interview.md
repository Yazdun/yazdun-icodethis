# How to Ace Your Take Home Assignment in Your Developer Job Interview?

The take-home assignment is one of the most common methods used by recruiters to evaluate a candidate's qualifications for a position. While you might assume that this type of interview is simpler, the truth is that take-home assignments can be just as challenging as technical interviews.

In this article, I will guide you through the process of completing take-home assignments. I'll help you avoid common pitfalls and shed light on what recruiters expect from you during this evaluation phase. By implementing these tips and tricks, you'll undoubtedly set yourself apart from other candidates and increase your chances of standing out in the competitive job market.

## What are take home assignments?

Before diving into the tips and tricks, it's essential to familiarize ourselves with what exactly take-home assignments are and what you can expect.

Take-home assignments are an evaluation phase within the job interview process, where recruiters provide you with a specific task to be completed within a specific timeframe. As a frontend developer, I've encountered various types of take-home assignments throughout my career, some of which are outlined below:

1. **Design Conversion Challenge:** Recruiters may provide you with a Figma design and request that you transform it into a functional website component. This commonly involves creating smaller elements, such as a carousel, or occasionally tackling more comprehensive tasks like building an entire landing page.

2. **API Integration Task:** In this scenario, recruiters provide you with an API endpoint along with instructions to fetch data and implement a specific feature. For instance, they might ask you to create a pagination component utilizing the provided data.

3. **Feature Implementation:** Recruiters may provide you with instructions for a particular feature and ask you to develop it using specific technologies. This type of assignment allows them to evaluate your proficiency in implementing desired functionalities.

These are just a few examples of the diverse range of take-home assignments you may encounter during job interviews. Now that we have a better understanding of what take home assignments are, let's explore some valuable tips and tricks which will help you to stand out from other candidates during this evaluation phase.

## Tips and Tricks for Take Home Assignments

### 1. Write professional commit messages

When working on take-home assignments, it's essential to write professional commit messages. This is because recruiters will often review your commit history to understand your thought process and how you approach problems.

You must avoid random commit messages such as "asdf" or "test" and instead write meaningful messages that describe the changes you've made. For instance, if you're implementing a carousel component, you might write a commit message such as "Implement carousel component with React and CSS."

### 2. Check your scores in the Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source tool that allows you to audit your website's performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. It's an excellent tool for evaluating your take-home assignments and ensuring that you've met all of the requirements.

This is probably the first thing that recruiters will do while reviewing your assignment, so make sure that your app is scoring at least **90** in all categories. If you're not meeting the requirements, you can use Lighthouse to identify the issues and fix them accordingly.

If you're not familiar with Lighthouse, I recommend reading [this article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/).

### 3. Write unit tests

Unit tests are an essential part of any software development process. They allow you to ensure that your code is working as expected and that you haven't introduced any bugs.

While unit tests aren't always required for take-home assignments, they can help you stand out from other candidates. This is because recruiters will often review your code to understand how you approach problems and whether or not you're following best practices.

One thing that will set you completely apart from other candidates is writing end-to-end tests for your app. end-to-end tests are a type of automated test that allows you to simulate user behavior and ensure that your app is working as expected.

You can use tools such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to write end-to-end tests for your app.

### 4. Create clean README file for the project

A README file is a document that contains information about your project, such as how to install it and how to use it. It's an essential part of any software development process because it allows other developers to understand your code and how it works.

A decent README file should include the following information:

- **Installation instructions:** This section should contain instructions on how to install your app and any dependencies it requires. You can also include a link to the live demo if you've deployed your app.

- **Usage instructions:** This section should contain instructions on how to use your app and any additional information that might be helpful for other developers.

- **Contributing guidelines:** This section should contain information about how other developers can contribute to your project. You can also include a link to the GitHub repository if you've made it public.

Just try to keep your README file as simple as possible and avoid adding unnecessary information.

### 5. Donâ€™t add features that are not requested

When working on take-home assignments, it's essential to follow the instructions provided by recruiters and avoid adding features that aren't requested. You may think that adding extra features is a good idea but this isn't always the case.

Unexpected features can confuse recruiters and make them think that you didn't understand the requirements. Also in a real job, unexpected features can cause problems for other developers who are working on the same project, and these features will most likely be rejected.

So make sure that you're following the instructions provided by recruiters and avoid adding features that aren't requested.

## Conclusion

Take-home assignments are an excellent way for recruiters to evaluate your skills and determine whether or not you're a good fit for the position. While these assignments may seem deceptively straightforward, they can be just as challenging as technical interviews.

By understanding the expectations of recruiters and employing the tips and tricks outlined in this article, you can set yourself apart from other candidates and increase your chances of success.
